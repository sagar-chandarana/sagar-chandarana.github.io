	Hello dear,
	<br><br>
	A few days ago, I had a dream. Or I can say, a nightmare, because in that dream, I had lost my legs. After I woke up, I touched my feet with so much love and appreciation, that I have never shown to my body before. I ran my hands accross the whole of my body and let myself indulge in self-love and self-appreciation. 
	<br><br>
	One of the things we take for granted in life, is our body, and for the first time I could feel how would the life be without one of my limbs. All my silly problems vanished in that moment, and a new desire awakened. A desire to be grateful to my body and my skills, and put them to work in a meaningful way. That's when I found you guys.
	<br><br>
	I am writing you this letter, in order to let you know that I am willing to work with you guys in anyway I can. By profession I am a computer programmer, but honestly I can improvise a lot of things when I am with a sense of purpose.
	<br><br>
	Thank you for your time.
	<br><br>
	Wish you a great day,
	<br>
	Sagar
</p>
